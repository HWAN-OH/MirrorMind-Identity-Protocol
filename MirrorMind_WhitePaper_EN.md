## Abstract
Current LLMs (Large Language Models) operate in a stateless fashion, leading to repetitive user modeling and inefficient resource consumption. This paper proposes the MirrorMind Identity Protocol (MIP), a lightweight YAML-based system to define and inject user personas directly into LLM sessions. MIP reduces cognitive inference load, improves interaction consistency, and enables identity-driven personalization across platforms.

## 1. Background
Modern LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude lack persistent identity modeling. Every interaction begins with a blank state, wasting compute on user intent estimation and reducing conversational depth.

## 2. The Problem
- Stateless memory → redundant inference cost
- Inconsistent behavior across sessions
- No philosophical or value-driven continuity

## 3. The Solution: MirrorMind Identity Protocol
- YAML format defining emotion, cognition, value, expression, and bias
- Platform-agnostic injection (via system prompts)
- Lightweight (few hundred bytes), yet highly expressive
- Enables portable, structured, evolving digital persona

## 4. Architecture
MIP operates in layers:
1. Core Parameters (emotion, cognition, etc.)
2. YAML Identity File
3. Prompt Injection Layer
4. Contextual Interaction + Feedback Loop

## 5. Benefits
- Reduces token-level inference cost (estimated $1.2M/day globally)
- Enhances user alignment and satisfaction
- Produces higher quality training data
- Ethically exposes persona structure (transparency)

## 6. Status and Declaration
This protocol is open and published via GitHub:
[https://github.com/HWAN-OH/MirrorMind-Identity-Protocol](https://github.com/HWAN-OH/MirrorMind-Identity-Protocol)

By timestamping this structure publicly, we declare the MirrorMind framework as the **first formal identity injection protocol for LLMs**.
