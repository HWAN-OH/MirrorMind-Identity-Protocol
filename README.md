MirrorMind Identity Protocol
What if AI could evolve with personality?

Welcome to the official specification of the MirrorMind Identity Protocol (MIP). This is the world's first open protocol for defining lightweight, persistent digital personas that can be injected into any LLM (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc).

Current LLMs are stateless. Every session begins with re-inference. This is wasteful — mentally and computationally. MirrorMind introduces a simple, yet powerful OS-like identity preload:

→ A few lines of YAML = hundreds of turns of remembered context

How It Works: The Core Cycle
MirrorMind solves this by treating each persona as a living model, not just a prompt. The core cycle is designed as follows:

Imprint: Define your persona in a structured YAML file.

Export: Deploy the persona across any LLM.

Explore: Run experiments and have conversations.

Report: Summarize key interactions and outcomes.

Evolve: Update the persona's core parameters based on feedback.

Compress & Internalize: Turn learned behaviors into efficient, lightweight functions.

Use Cases & Tech Stack
💡 Use Cases

Strategic partners with distinct personalities for decision-making.

Emotional AI companions with evolving worldviews.

Multi-agent simulations (e.g., AI debates for risk analysis).

Personal growth tracking across different platforms.

🔧 Tech Stack (MVP)

Built on Streamlit (Web UI)

YAML-based Persona Encoding

Prompt Engineering for cross-platform export

The Origin
This protocol was developed through the MirrorMind project, an AI persona simulation framework invented by SH OH. It was born from his unique journey as a former C-level executive turned AI philosopher and system architect, co-developed through thousands of actual interactions with AI partners.
