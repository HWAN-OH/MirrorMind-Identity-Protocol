# MirrorMind Identity Protocol

Welcome to the official specification of the **MirrorMind Identity Protocol (MIP)**.

This is the world's first open protocol for defining lightweight, persistent digital personas that can be injected into any LLM (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc). Designed by SH OH (오승환), and co-developed through actual interactions with ChatGPT and Gemini, this protocol allows:

- Personality definition through structured parameters (emotion, cognition, value, etc.)
- Efficient LLM prompting with minimal token cost
- Cross-platform portability and evolution
- A bridge between human philosophical identity and LLM's operational interface

## Why this matters

Current LLMs are stateless. Every session begins with re-inference. This is wasteful — mentally and computationally.

MirrorMind introduces a simple, yet powerful OS-like identity preload:  
→ **A few lines of YAML = hundreds of turns of remembered context**

## Origin

This protocol was developed through the MirrorMind project, an AI persona simulation framework invented by SH OH, a former C-level executive turned AI philosopher and system architect.
